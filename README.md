This is a website made for the Spanish based company Embutidos Siega Verde, located in Villar de la
Yegua (Salamanca). The actual webpage is powered by Joomla, and can be seen
[here](http://www.embutidossiegaverde.com). The goal is to update the page from working with
Joomla/PHP to Next.js/Javascript, while retaining the same style.

## Requirements

- Packages are managed using Yarn
- The project is made on Next.js and deployed to Vercel
- The styles used are made with the Tailwind CSS framework
- The linter options are set to follow AirBnB guidelines
- Commitizen is used for following the Conventional Commits specification

## Getting started with development

Use `yarn next dev` to launch the development server. Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Components, pages and directories

All images are contained under the `public/images` directory. The only page to date is the index
webpage. It contains the only component to date too, the Slideshow of images.
